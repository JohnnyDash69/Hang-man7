# Hangman Game

Welcome to the Hangman game built with React! In this game, you will guess letters to uncover a hidden word. With each incorrect guess, a part of the hangman figure will be drawn. If you guess the word correctly before the hangman is fully drawn, you win!

## Game Rules

1. The game will pick a random word for you to guess.
2. You can guess the word by selecting letters one at a time.
3. Each incorrect guess will result in a part of the hangman being drawn (e.g., head, body, arms, legs).
4. If you guess all the letters correctly before the hangman is fully drawn, you win!
5. If the hangman is fully drawn before you guess the word, you lose.
6. You can restart the game at any time by clicking the "Restart Game" button.
7. The game also provides a help section with rules and instructions.

## Installation Instructions

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed on your machine.

### Steps to Run the Application Locally

1. **Clone the repository**:
    git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
   
3. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    cd repository-name

4. **Install the dependencies**: Inside the project folder, run the following command to install all necessary dependencies:
    npm install

5. **Start the application**: Once the dependencies are installed, start the application by running:
    npm start

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
